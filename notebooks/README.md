# Notebooks

The notebooks in this directory serve as an accompaniment to the Sigment [documentation](https://notes.eonu.net/docs/sigment/). They give some examples of practical use of the library.

The suggest order to read the notebooks in is:

1. [Using Transformations](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/eonu/sigment/blob/master/notebooks/Using%20Transformations.ipynb): Covers the basics on the general usage of transformations.
2. [Custom Transformations](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/eonu/sigment/blob/master/notebooks/Custom%20Transformations.ipynb): Covers the basics of creating a custom transformation.
3. [Using Quantifiers](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/eonu/sigment/blob/master/notebooks/Using%20Quantifiers.ipynb): Covers the basics on the general usage of quantifiers.

[README.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/eonu/sigment/blob/master/notebooks/README.ipynb) is an additional notebook that contains the code necessary to reproduce the visualization on the repository [README](https://github.com/eonu/sigment/blob/master/README.md) page.
